# Task 3: Migrations

We have now created to entities in the database project. We need to construct the database itself.

To create migrations, we will use the command line.
There are UI tools also, but we will focus on the cli tools.

Navigate to the following folder from the root, before issuing any commands under.

```shell
cd src/FagDag.EfCore.Database
```

Note: The commands are not complete, e.g. startup project or project is e.g. missing in the commands.
Idea is that you explore and use the tool, and not just copy paste, but they will contain enough information to understand how to use them.

Note: if you are in the Database project running commands, you will need to supply a startup project.
If you are in the Api project running commands, you will need to supply a project.

## Useful commands

Short list of useful commands that you should try out now and again during the different exerices.

```shell
dotnet ef dbcontext info
dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes
dotnet ef migrations list
```

## Create an initial migration

To create the migration of the model, we will use the command line.
We need to create a new migration file in the `Migrations` folder.

```shell
dotnet ef migrations add <nameofmigration>
```

The migration folder should no be populated by two files.

Inspect the files in the `Migrations` folder.
Note: If there is a new folder `Migrations` in the Api project, somethings has gone wrong.
