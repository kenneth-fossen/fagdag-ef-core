# Task 4: Seeding

In this task, you will implement a method to seed the database with initial data.

There are many ways to do this we will try, Bogus Faker, and you add data in migrations.

Note: Be sure to have completed any pending migrations before applying this code.

## Seeding Bogus Faker

Bogus is a library for generating fake data. It can be used to generate random data for testing purposes.

Install the `Bogus` package using NuGet Package Manager.

To the `optionsBuilder` for `DbContextOptions` add a chained call to `.UseSeeding((context, _) => { ... }`.

The `...` you will fill with the code that generates your data.

Example to replace `...`.

```csharp
 var faker = new Faker<T:<typeYouCreated>>()
            .UseSeed(420)
            .RuleFor(x => x.Id, f => f.Random.Guid());
            //... add for as many fields as you have

var eventsToSeed = faker.Generate(5);
var contains = context.Set<Event>().Contains(eventsToSeed[0]);
if (!contains)
{
    context.Set<Event>().AddRange(eventsToSeed);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

## Configure the API

In Program.cs add the following code after
`var app = builder.Build();`

```csharp
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
using (var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<EpicEventsDbContext>())
{
    dbContext.Database.EnsureCreated();
}
```

## Run the API

See that the database gets filled with data.
Open the database and view the data.

This can be done through your IDE or plugins in e.g. VSCode for SQLite.

## Manual Migration customization

If you want a challenge, try to implement the manual migration customization.
