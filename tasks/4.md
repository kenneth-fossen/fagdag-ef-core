# Task 4: Seeding

From now on, we can use all the commands we used up until now from the `FagDag.EfCore.Api` project instead.

Navigate to the `FagDag.EfCore.Api` project and run the following command:

```shell
dotnet ef migrations list
```

In this task, you will implement a method to seed the database with initial data.

There are many ways to do this we will try, Bogus Faker, and you add data in migrations.

Note: Be sure to have completed any pending migrations before applying this code.

## Seeding Bogus Faker

We will work with the `FagDag.EfCore.Api` project, and all the changes can be done in `Program.cs`.

Bogus is a library for generating fake data. It can be used to generate random data for testing purposes.

Install the `Bogus` package using NuGet Package Manager.

```shell
dotnet add package Bogus
```

The `builder.Services.AddDbContext<EpicEventsDbContext>(optionsBuilder =>
    optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=EpicEvents.db"));` lambda can be expanded as following.

To the `optionsBuilder` for `DbContextOptions` add a chained call to `.UseSeeding((context, _) => { ... }`.

The `...` you will fill with the code that generates your data.

Example to replace `...`.

```csharp
 var faker = new Faker<T:<typeYouCreated>>()
            .UseSeed(420)
            .RuleFor(x => x.Id, f => f.Random.Guid());
            //... add for as many fields as you have

var eventsToSeed = faker.Generate(5);
var contains = context.Set<Event>().Contains(eventsToSeed[0]);
if (!contains)
{
    context.Set<Event>().AddRange(eventsToSeed);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

## Configure the API

In `Program.cs` add the following code after
`var app = builder.Build();`

```csharp
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
using (var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<EpicEventsDbContext>())
{
    dbContext.Database.EnsureCreated();
}
```

Note: If you used `.SeedAsync(..)`, (..Async calls), it is important that `.EnsureCreated()`
is also run async. e.g. `.EnsureCreatedAsync()`.
We will for this task we will use the synchronous alternatives.

## Run the API

See that the database gets filled with data.
Open the database and view the data.

This can be done through your IDE or plugins in e.g. VSCode for SQLite.

## Manual Migration customization

If you want a challenge, try to implement the manual migration customization.
