# Task 5: Querying & LINQ

This task is to implement a service that queries events (and the other models) from the database.
I have created a skeleton service that we can write queries in.

Tasks to investigate:

- Breakpoints to inspect the SQL Statements
- Change Query strategy (Split vs Single)
- Change Query strategy globally
- TagWith
- IEnumerable casting
- Explicit joins
- Implicit joins
- foreach over IEnumerable queries (Goal: Multiple Enumerations)

Note: You are free to change the code as much as you want,
 signatures, adding helpers, rewriting as much as you want and so forth.

## Events: Implementing the service for querying events

We have two endpoints and data in the database now.
Implement using the tricks we have discussed in the theory session.

## Participants: Add the Participants

From the model.md or model.pdf.
The rest of the model, step by step or everything at once, approach it as you want.
I recommend, using step by step, using all the tools we have become familiar with.

1. Create Entity
2. Update DbContext
3. Add Migration
4. Review and/or tweek the config (e.g. index, fk, etc.)
5. Update the database
6. Create seeding data / Inspect data in database
7. Implement the service for querying events (new or use the one we have created)
8. Implement Endpoints
9. Inspect data with API

## Tips: Queries to try

- List all nationalities participating in an advent
- Count all the nationalities for an event
- Count all the events a participant has attended
- List all locations where a participant has attended
- List all participants who have attended an event
