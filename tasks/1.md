# Getting Ready

Just a simple startup task such that we all are onboard and ready to start working on the project.

## Verify .NET

Two commands to verify that we are using the correct version of .NET.

```shell
❯ dotnet --list-sdks  
9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]

❯ dotnet --list-runtimes
Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]
Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]
```

If this does not work, you are missing .NET 9 on your machine.
You can install it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## EF Core CLI Tools

To run Migrations we need the Entity Framework CLI tools

This can be installed with:

```shell
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

When you have installed it you should explore it:

```shell
❯ dotnet ef --version
Entity Framework Core .NET Command-line Tools
9.0.2
```

## Build Project

Build the project to ensure that all dependencies are resolved.
From the root of the repository.

```shell
cd src/FagDag.EfCore.Api
dotnet build
```

If there are no warnings, the project is built successfully. If you encounter any errors, review the error messages and resolve them accordingly.

Now run the project and vist the Scalar OpenAPI Definition for the project.
In the same folder.

```shell
dotnet run
open http://localhost:5001/ 
```

You should now have a page that shows all the API endpoints.

PS: You can also use your favorite IDE run the project, just configure accordingly.
