# Task 2: Create a simple model

Our first task is to create the Event entity for our database.

1. Review the model in model.md or model.pdf

3. In `EpicEventsDbContext` configure the entity.

    Use one or try all of the following:
    1. Use the Fluent API to configure the entity
    2. Use the Grouping configuration
    3. Use data annotation to configure the model
